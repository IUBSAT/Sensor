# Sensors

code for the bme sensor, with correct measurements in rust (i am running rustc and cargo)

Note: git would not allow me to add/ push anything in here so I just copies the important files 
Note 2: you will need to create your own rust project for this and then just copy and paste the files 
Note 3: you will probably have to 'cargo install' a bunch of stuff, use cargo build to figure out what you will need to install (some things might be 'cargo add' so if 'cargo install' doesn't work try 'cargo add')
